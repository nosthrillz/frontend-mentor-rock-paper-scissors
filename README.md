## My process

### Built with

- React.js with context
- SCSS
- CSS in JS: styled-components
- styled-react-modal

### What I learned

I needed to practice styled-components and this project was great for that. I also finally managed to create a nice context without having to search for anything :)

### Continued development

I need to refactor to simplify the code and maybe potentially storing the state in local storage, so you can keep your scores.
